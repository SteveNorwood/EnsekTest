# EnsekTest

Welcome to the tech test that I have completed for Ensek. Here is a quick rundown of how I have completed the task:
1. Created the entities required for the data provided
1. Created the database context using sqlite
1. Created a scaffolded REST API to handle the data from the entity framework context
1. Created an ASP.NET MVC Web Application, to display the data on the front end
1. Created services within MVC application to handle the connection between the MVC controller and the API
1. Seeded the database with the test data provided
1. Started creating unit tests for the application

I believe that I probably went a little over the 1-2 hour mark for the solution, however if I had more time, I would implement the following:
1. Complete unit tests for the API controllers and the services that communicate with the API at a minimum
1. Add the ability to add/remove/edit accounts to the website
1. Add the ability to add/edit meter readings to the website
1. Add a bulk import to the website, that would allow .csv files of the same format originally provided to be uploaded to the system
